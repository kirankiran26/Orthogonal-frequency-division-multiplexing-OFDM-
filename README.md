
OFDM Transceiver Using GNU Radio and SDR
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transceiver using GNU Radio and Software-Defined Radio (SDR) hardware (USRP B210). The OFDM transceiver enables real-time transmission and reception of data, addressing key challenges such as symbol timing synchronization, frequency offset correction, and channel estimation.

Project Features
Software Tools: GNU Radio Companion (GRC) for designing flowgraphs.

Hardware: USRP B210 for data transmission and reception.

Implementation: The transceiver was simulated and built using GRC with a focus on:

Symbol timing synchronization

Frequency offset correction

Channel estimation

Adaptive modulation and coding techniques to enhance performance.

Testing: The system was tested under various channel conditions to assess its performance in real-world scenarios.

Key Components
GNU Radio: An open-source toolkit for building SDR applications using modular signal processing blocks.

SDR (Software-Defined Radio): A reconfigurable radio communication system where software handles functions like modulation, filtering, and amplifying traditionally done by hardware.

OFDM: A digital modulation technique that uses orthogonal subcarriers to transmit data efficiently and is robust against multipath interference.
